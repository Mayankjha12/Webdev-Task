<div class="project-card">
<h3>Contacts Book</h3>
<p>I created a feature-rich CRUD web application using the Python Flask framework that enables users to securely manage their contacts. I implemented user authentication with password hashing to ensure data security. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete contact entries stored in a SQL database. I developed REST APIs for smooth data interaction and integrated search functionality to easily filter contacts. Additionally, I designed the front end using HTML and CSS to deliver a clean and intuitive interface and managed the project with Git version control on GitHub</p>

<h3>ML Regression Model for Predictive Analysis</h3>
<p>I created an end-to-end machine learning pipeline in Python to predict numerical outcomes with scikit-learn regression models. I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering to improve prediction accuracy. I trained and evaluated models using metrics such as the RÂ² score to measure performance. To make the results interpretable, I generated insightful visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn, highlighting key data patterns and model insights.

<h3>World Clock Web Application</h3>
<p>I created a responsive web application that displays real-time clocks for multiple cities around the world. I used JavaScript date-time APIs to dynamically fetch and update the time for each location. I designed a grid-based layout with CSS to present all clocks in an organized and visually appealing manner. This project demonstrates my front-end development skills and my ability to handle asynchronous JavaScript operations effectively.</p>
